### [about me](https://abradaric.me/)   |   [projects](./projects.html) | [django&react CRUD app](./djreact.html)   |  why?

Some time ago I had a project of making CRUD app with tech stack of choice. I stumbled upon [this classic](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f) and decided (accepted?) to suffer in silence and get on with it. I picked my stack based on [this tried and trusted method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz-PtEJEaqY).

And to be honest I was pleased with the choice (_no chickens were harmed during the making of this app_). It's nice to work both in [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [react](https://reactjs.org/). App is a simple one, users can read some stuff when not logged in, create/read/update/delete (_CRUD_) stuff when they are logged in. Some stuff also can't be read unless user is logged in. React communicates with an API ([DRF](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)).
