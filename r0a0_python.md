* * *

Raspbian (Raspberry Pi os) comes with Python 3.5. I really, really like f-strings, introduced in Python 3.6. Python 3.7 is generally faster too. Enter [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). [Automatic installer](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer) is recommended. Basically, pyenv lets you change python version per user or per project.

Sometimes you'll need different versions of some package for different projects. It's generally bad idea to mess with system packages in these cases. Enter [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv). Check installation guide [here](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv) (pragmatic installation part).

Install pyenv & pipenv on both Raspberry and your desktop OS.
