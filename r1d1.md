If Anakin was able to build himself an android with what he had on Tatooine, then you can build an android too. You have Ebay and Aliexpress! And you're not a slave like he was, which means you have more free time!

You may be limited by other things though. By money for things you want, or computing capabilities of things you can afford. Well, if you can't afford 3D printer, you can afford duct tape!

You'll definitely need [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/). Get yourself a Pi 3. Get some [housing](https://amzn.to/2Adzo7S) for it. Not necessarily that one, but make sure you can access GPIO pins and CSI slot (for camera). Yeah, you'll need a [camera](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/) too.

To power the Pi, you'll need a power source with 5V 2.4A output. Something like [this](https://bit.ly/2yI0cLD), but not necessarily. As for capacity, go with your pocket depth. Not below 10Ah though.

Your car/robot/android (it will evolve!) needs to move around. It will be able to with [these](https://bit.ly/2QTSllA). You won't be connecting these directly to Pi. They'll need their own power. If you don't mind soldering, [this](https://ebay.to/2pVbNDh) is good option. If you mind soldering, get yourself an [L298N](https://ebay.to/2NKH05v). It is not as efficient as the other option, but it's easier to work with. For power, nowadays [LiPo](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/graphene-2200mah-3s-45c-w-xt60.html) batteries are the best. They require special charger too. Or, you can get some NiMH rechargeable batteries and put them in one of [these](https://ebay.to/2pWM799). NiMH AA batteries are 1.2V, so get at least 6 of them. They are cheaper, but a lot heavier too.

All of this needs to fit somewhere. If you don't have 3D printer then you can't print custom 3D chasis either. [Something like this](https://bit.ly/2Adqszo) will do. Don't forget duct tape! You'll need [wires](https://ebay.to/2RPpYGy) to connect stuff.
